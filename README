This is Math::Units 1.2, the first official release of a powerful
unit conversion system written completely in Perl.  This module
has been tested fairly well using the GNU units program as a
baseline.  Although unit conversion is conceptually simple, there
are lots of places where bugs can hide.  THIS SOFTWARE DOES NOT HAVE
A WARRANTY!  If you use this software, please verify that the units
you are converting are correctly handled.  If you find a bug in
either the code or the conversion tables, please send them to me
as soon as possible and I will publish a correction immediately.

For more information, read the documentation found in Units.pm.

To build this module, cd to the directory that contains this README
file and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make

Please run the regression test after you build the module:

	perl t/regress.pl

If everything passes, install the module:

	make install

Any questions or comments?  Please send them to <fox@vulpes.com>.
